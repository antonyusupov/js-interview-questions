There is a eval() method that can be problem in real world projects AVOID using eval() method it has security issues and your other functions may not work properly!
There is a API that is Rapid API you can change the API url and Put API key that will work and use webpack to hide your API keys. This is the view of the all works I made. Design was *PERFECT :) Hope That will give you a hint and help little bit.![screencapture-127-0-0-1-5500-2023-01-13-17_50_52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74938284/212352259-2b7957f6-6d00-4d07-82d2-6527540d8e4a.png)
